\chapter{Context}

\section{Need Statement}
Airlines are always searching for new ways to get more people on a flight and more money per flight, making the seats in the aircraft smaller and closer. As the seats get smaller, the personal space for a passenger shrinks, making it harder for anyone to move and fit comfortably in the cabin as shown in \ref{fig:1}.

With the emergence of global business, people are constantly on the go today and airports are becoming larger and larger, growing more busy each year.  The distance from check-in to gate is increasing as more airlines expand routes and terminals grow.  As the airports grow, it becomes harder to make the travel between check-in and gate short and quick.  Therefore, it becomes a problem for passengers that have a hard time walking long distances or need assistance with bags or wheelchair. More airport staff is needed to move the passengers with assistance needs, and they are not trained in dealing with disabilities.  The airlines have such limited space in the cabin because of the increased amount of seats that the assistive devices have to be stored in the cargo hold, making them susceptible to damage.  The flying experience is tailored to a person that has all of his mobility. The experience is not designed for persons who do not have the mobility or have some impairment that requires additional time. 

What if the cabin was equipped with assistive devices to allow limited mobility passengers to move around the cabin comfortably and independently? What if the assistive devices had a special storage system to prevent damage and to provide the passengers with a sense of security?  These such systems would create an experience that is comfortable and make the airline and aircraft manufacturer more popular among its customers because the final user, the passenger, is the one the plane is designed for. 


\section{Problem Statement}
The need of our users or the problems facing our users can be broken down into two areas to be addressed:

\begin{list}{-}{}
  \item Mobility in the Cabin
  \item Storage and Security of Assistive Devices
\end{list}

The whole process (see Appendix – Diagram A1) was analyzed, and the current systems that are in use today are based on what is required by the FAA and ADA regulations.  However, these systems have gaps that need to fix in order to improve the user and passenger experience.  Last quarter’s user interviews showed the gaps and led to these two main pain points. These two pain points of mobility within the cabin and storage and security of assistive devices address our group of users who are passengers with limited mobility that use assistive devices.  Our users want to be able to transfer from their wheelchair to the aisle chair independently and without the interference of others.  They also want to know that their wheelchair will be handled with the utmost care and returned to them in working condition with no damage at all.   This is what our user needs and wants addressed in order to have a better flying experience that is more personal, allows independence, and provides peace of mind. In addition, the airport staff and flight attendants need to be considered to ensure that they can use the new systems with ease and without increased time committment by making the solution inclusive into the flight crew's tasks.


\section{Vision Statement}

Imagine you are packing for a trip and you pack your most important possession in your carry-on.   But when you arrive at the gate, you are required to gate check your bag.  You immediately panic. You do not know if the bag will be damaged. What if it gets lost? Put on the wrong flight? Your entire flight is ruined because all you can think about is what state your bag will be when you arrive since airlines do not have the best reputation concerning luggage handling.  Now imagine if this was your wheelchair.  Your legs. Your independence. What if you had no clue how you were going to move now that you do not have your chair? What if your activity in the cabin was limited due to the loss of your chair?   For our users, this is a struggle every time they board a plane and have to endure a flight of misery and constant worry.  What if we could eliminate this unease, worry and fear by designing a new system that allows the user to put their own wheelchair into its “personal spot”, to know how it was handled, to know it was safe, and to know where it is at all times and that it will be there when they disembark?  What if we could design a way for them to be able to move in the cabin with ease and make the bathroom and other tasks more accessible? 

The two systems described in the story above are our vision and focus for the final product. Our users are in need of independence.  The current systems that are utilized today on airplanes and in airports require our users to be assisted by airport or airline personnel for every task that requires mobility.  The user interviews from fall quarter stressed the importance of independence and the pain points that the lack of independence create in the flying experience.  Therefore, the theme of independence was the driving force behind the solution and design space described above.  With independence in mind, mobility in the cabin and storage and security of the wheelchair were the two places that independence broke down the most in the flight experience. The pain point of mobility in the cabin is being addressed by redesigning the aisle chair.  The new aisle chair will allow for user control during boarding and disembarking, for ease of independent transfer using a sliding seat, and for ease of mobility in the cabin such as using the restroom. The storage and security of the wheelchair will be accomplished with a specialized shipping container that allows for the wheelchair to be strapped or tied down in the jet way in front of the user. The user will be able to supervise the entire process and will receive updates as the container is loaded into the cargo hold.  These two solutions will be bringing independence and control back to our users and creating a more desirable experience.

The corporate partner for this design project is Embraer.  Since 1969, Embraer has been involved in all aspects of the aviation field.  Embraer began with support from the Brazilian Government to produce military aircraft in addition to its small passenger planes.  Embraer then expanded to agricultural planes and later to commercial planes and business/private jets.  Embraer has over 5,000 aircraft operating in over 80 countries.  They are the market leader for commercial jets with fewer than 120 seats.  Embraer is interested in expanding its commercial market to larger commercial jets, in maintaining some of the best executive jets, and in entering new defense markets.

\section{The Design Team}
Team Embraer was assembled using the results of the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) to determine compatible thinking styles and personality traits and through interviews to meet the skill requirements for this project.  Additionally, our team has a diverse educational, cultural, and social background that encompasses many skill sets and multiple areas of study.
