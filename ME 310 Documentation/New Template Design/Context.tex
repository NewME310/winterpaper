\section{Need Statement}
Airlines are always searching for new ways to get more people on a flight and more money per flight, making the seats in the aircraft smaller and closer. As the seats get smaller, the personal space for a passenger shrinks, making it harder for anyone to move and fit comfortably as shown in Figure \ref{fig:1}.

With the emergence of global business, people are constantly on the go today and airports are becoming larger and larger, growing more busy each year.  The distance from check-in to gate is increasing as more airlines expand routes and terminals grow.  As the airports grow, it becomes harder to make the travel distance between check-in and gate short and quick.  Therefore, it becomes a problem for passengers that have a hard time walking long distances or need assistance with bags or a wheelchair. More airport staff is needed to move the passengers with assistance needs, and often the staff is not trained in dealing with disabilities.  Airlines have such limited space in the cabin because of the increased amount of seats that the assistive devices have to be stored in the cargo hold, making them susceptible to damage.  The flying experience today is tailored to a person that has all of his/her mobility, leaving out those who do not have the mobility or have some impairment that requires additional time. However, 58 million Americans live with a disability, including 5.5 million military veterans. \cite{}

Would it not be great if the flying experience were individually tailored to a person’s needs? What is the cabin could be redesigned to improve the flying experience for the passengers with limited mobility as well as for the average passenger? Such design would create an experience that is comfortable; making the airline and aircraft manufacturer more popular among its customers because the final user, the passenger, is the one the plane is designed for.

\section{Problem Statement}
To make this problem more tangible and approachable, we broke the project into different focus areas:

\begin{list}{-}{}
  \item Current systems in use in the airport and on the airplane
  \item User's Needs
  \item User'��s Complaints
  \item Identification of Critical Users
\end{list}

The whole process (see Appendix A�� Diagram A1) was analyzed and current systems that are in use based on FAA and ADA regulations were researched to determine the gaps in the system.  The gaps helped identify possible user needs.  In addition, user interviews were conducted to determine more needs and used to focus exact needs that we could address with our solution.  The interviews enlightened us with complaints that the current users had and ideas on where possible innovation areas lay.

For our problem, two distinct groups of users were quickly identified, the flight crew and the passengers with limited mobility.   The passengers with limited mobility were a very straightforward user group as it was identified in the problem statement.  However, the flight crew is the user that will have to use the solution on an everyday or every flight basis.  Therefore, the ease of use and the inclusion into the flight crew tasks have to be considered in order to make the solution a success.

\section{Corporate Partner: Embraer}

\end{figure}

The corporate partner for this design project is Embraer.  Since 1969, Embraer has been involved in all aspects of the aviation field.  Embraer began with support from the Brazilian Government to produce military aircraft in addition to its small passenger planes.  Embraer then expanded to agricultural planes and later to commercial planes and business/private jets.  Embraer has over 5,000 aircraft operating in over 80 countries.  They are the market leader for commercial jets with fewer than 120 seats.  Embraer is interested in expanding its commercial market to larger commercial jets, in maintaining some of the best executive jets, and in entering new defense markets.
