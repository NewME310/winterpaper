% Rename this file to whatever you like (e.g. OurFallDoc.tex) and modify the title, authors
% etc. below. If you rename the section files (e.g. Ch2context.tex) you'll need to change
% the \include{ } calls in this document as well.

% Don't modify this stuff unless you know what you're doing...
% We are using the "memoir" class, a widely used set of macros book-like documents.
% If you get errors that you are missing the "memoir" package you can download and 
% install it:   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

% memoir document class for standard USA letter paper, printed one side
\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper,oneside]{memoir}

%\pagestyle{companion}    % If you want fancier page headers 
\usepackage{graphicx}        % standard LaTeX graphics 
\usepackage{color}               % support for colored fonts
\usepackage{url}  \urlstyle{same}     % deal with url strings in bibliography

%Optional fonts if you don't like the default in Latex
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%\usepackage{mathptmx}  %This will give you Times Roman, like default in MS Word.
%\usepackage{charter}       %This will give you a slightly bolder Charter font

%%%%%%%%%BEGIN ANY CUSTOM ABBREVIATIONS%%%%%%
% Define any abbreviations that will apply throughout the document
% to save typing. Examples:
\def\pmt{{\em Papier M\^{a}ch\`{e}}}  %Define "\pmt" to print "Papier Mache" with accents +1space
\def\cbike{{\em Casterbike} \,}  %Define "\cbike" to print "Casterbike " italicized +1space
%%%%%%%%%END CUSTOM ABBREVIATIONS%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%DRAFT COMMENTS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Allow comments (remarks) to be shown or hidden.
% Put optional text in \begin{remark} ... \end{remark}  environments.
%The usage is a bit counterintuitive: \commentsoff makes them visible; \commentson hides them.
%\commentson{remark} %Don't print remarks.
\commentsoff{remark}  %Do print remarks. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   BEGIN THE MAIN DOCUMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{document}

%If you want a figure on the cover page, this is where it goes.
%7 cm is about max figure height before messing up title spacing.
%If making your own fancy coverpage (e.g. in Photoshop) then comment out 
%the \includegraphics{ } and use the \vspace{ } command.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
  %An example cover image, from 2008 ME310 Kodak project
  \includegraphics[height= 7cm]{Figures/Ch1frontmatter/KodakThing.pdf}
%\vspace{3 cm}    %Use this instead when you have no cover picture 
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Make the title page using arguments defined above.
\titlep

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Load file "Executive.tex" for the Executive summary.
% Remember, this is a stand-alone section for executives to read.
\include{Executive}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% TOC and LOF are automatically generated -- Note that sometimes have to "compile" Latex THREE
% times to update the main .aux files, the TOC etc. files, and finally the PDF output with all changes
% propagated to the printout.
% Make Table of Contents title smaller than a normal Chapter heading:
\renewcommand{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\Large\bfseries}
\newpage
\tableofcontents*  %asterisk to prevent it from getting a number

% Optional Lists of Figures and Tables:
\newpage
\listoffigures*  %Note that for this you probably want to add the [short-headings] to captions.
%\listoftables  %I decided to omit the LOT in this example.

%Back to normal size for subsequent sections
\renewcommand{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\Huge\bfseries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Set up the Glossary. The template is looking for a file called
% "glossaryterms.tex" with glossary terms and definitions.
% You can either edit this file manually or you
% can use the Memoir glossary feature in which you insert items like
%   \glossary{glossary term}{our definition of what the term means}
% wherever you like, as you write your documentation.
% When you run the report through Latex, it will create a ".glo" file like
% "OurFallDocument.glo" which you can edit to create the file "glossaryterms.tex"
% There is also perl script I made which will do the formatting for you. 
%  perl Glo2Tex OurFallDocument.glo > glossaryterms.tex
\newpage
\section*{Glossary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Glossary}
\label{sec-glossary}
\begin{description}
\input{glossaryterms}   % input the list "glossaryterms.tex"
\end{description}

%%%%%% Example of an optionally printed "remark"
\begin{remark}
\color{blue}
It's a sign of a successful team that the glossary becomes extensive. Define any non-obvious or invented terms. For example, if you reference something by an acronym, that might be a glossary term. Teams also coin terms to describe design features. Define such terms here.  Don't define obvious stuff (axle, keyboard).  

See comments in me310report.tex if you want to generate a glossary semi-automatically from tagged keywords.
\normalcolor

%%%%%BEGIN BIBLIOGRAPHY%%%%%%%%%
% This is a two-step process in which you first create a ".bib" file, which is processed
% by bibtex into a ".bbl" file for loading into the document. 
% Many online journals and databases now have a feature to automatically download Bib
% citations.  BibDesk is a handy (free) program for Macintosh for managing them.
% EndNote and Refworks (is free to Stanford students) are good alternatives.
\bibliographystyle{plainurl310}     %Modified slightly from plainurl.bst 
\bibliography{me310reportfall}  % Look for file called "me310report.bib" 
%
% Alternatively, you can create your own bibliography list by hand.
% In that case, comment out the last line above and replace with  \input{OurBibFile}
