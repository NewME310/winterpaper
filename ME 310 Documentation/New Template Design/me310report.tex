%the \includegraphics{ } and use the \vspace{ } command.

  %An example cover image, from 2008 ME310 Kodak project

%%%%%BEGIN BIBLIOGRAPHY%%%%%%%%%
% This is a two-step process in which you first create a ".bib" file, which is processed
% by bibtex into a ".bbl" file for loading into the document. 
% Many online journals and databases now have a feature to automatically download Bib
% citations.  BibDesk is a handy (free) program for Macintosh for managing them.
% EndNote and Refworks (is free to Stanford students) are good alternatives.
\bibliographystyle{plainurl310}     %Modified slightly from plainurl.bst 
\bibliography{me310reportfall}  % Look for file called "me310report.bib" 
%
% Alternatively, you can create your own bibliography list by hand.
% In that case, comment out the last line above and replace with  \input{OurBibFile}
