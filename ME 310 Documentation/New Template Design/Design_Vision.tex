\subsection*{Vision}
Focusing on the needs of an underserved and suffering extreme user will enable us to design an all-inclusive universal solution. As those with disabilities require the most dramatic accommodation, a solution that would satiate their needs in a manner that normalizes their flying experience would also better the journey for all passengers. We thus aim to empower these extreme users by enabling greater autonomy while integrating them into a normative and shared flight experience, ultimately improving the comfort, convenience, and overall experience for all those sharing a flight.

The environment of both the airplane and airport will adapt to the needs of each individual. This futuristic system will be economically viable, as it will provide increased value to customers without a substantial weight increase or a loss of available seats. This additional value will foster a greater desire to travel by air and will consequently increase the quantity of prospective passengers.

In contrast to the “sardine in a can”-esque experience so prevalent today, the cabin in 30 years will be universally designed and provide a unique experience to each passenger. A more comfortable layout will liberate the passenger of unnecessary and harmful movements. Furthermore, the cabin’s design will diminish the requisite assistance sought today to help accomplish simple tasks (such as seating or going to the restroom).

\section{Accommodation System:}
The cabin will address several pain points with a system of accommodations. For example, the seats will have adjustable pitch. This will make it easier to get in and out of the seat. Furthermore, the seats would be adjustable for different body types, thus effectively improving comfort and satisfaction for the traveler. 

\section{Seat configuration:}
The seat configuration will promote social interaction rather than personal entertainment. As a result, passengers could transplant their home experience into the plane; families can spend quality time together while friends can converse and play games. Business travellers will be able to work and participate in meetings as if they spent the flight within their offices. In other words, the cabin accommodates a variety of passengers by carrying their experience from home or work into the airplane.

\section{Micro-airports:}
Airports will shrink considerably, as there will be no more need to check-in physically, check luggage or arrive three hours in advance of flights. While airplanes will still transport a great amount of people, the boarding experience will be much like that of hailing a cab. The flight experience will be as simple as reserving a ticket, showing on time for departure, checking-in one’s luggage when boarding and flying to one’s destination.

\section{The Personalized Information Era:}
Information will be ubiquitous and fed in real time. Messages will be tailored to each individual’s needs. The message will be transmitted with respect to the capacities of each passenger. Instead of being the era of information, it will be the era of personalized information, with accessibility and customization granted to all. This information can be brought into the cabin such that when you check in, the seat knows it’s you and automatically adjusts to your preferences.

\section{The Experience}
The solutions we developed are aligned with the group's vision because they seek to solve the individual problems of each user using global solutions. Thus, the flight condition is improved for all who use the software, processes and devices proposed, regardless of whether the passenger is disabled or not. When we developed a swivel seat, an application or an adjustable seat pitch, we considered that everyone can and should have access to a pleasant and comfortable experience. Each human being should have a special experience because a trip takes more than passengers; it carries dreams of a memorable tour or a successful business trip.
